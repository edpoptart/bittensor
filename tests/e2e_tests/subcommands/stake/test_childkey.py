def test_set_revoke_children(local_chain, capsys):
    """
    Test the setting and revoking of children hotkeys for staking.

    This test case covers the following scenarios:
    1. Setting multiple children hotkeys with specified proportions
    2. Retrieving children information
    3. Revoking all children hotkeys
    4. Verifying the absence of children after revocation

    The test uses three wallets (Alice, Bob, and Eve) and performs operations
    on a local blockchain.

    Args:
        local_chain: A fixture providing access to the local blockchain
        capsys: A pytest fixture for capturing stdout and stderr

    The test performs the following steps:
    - Set up wallets for Alice, Bob, and Eve
    - Create a subnet and register wallets
    - Add stake to Alice's wallet
    - Set Bob and Eve as children of Alice with specific proportions
    - Verify the children are set correctly
    - Get and verify children information
    - Revoke all children
    - Verify children are revoked
    - Check that no children exist after revocation

    This test ensures the proper functioning of setting children hotkeys,
    retrieving children information, and revoking children in the staking system.
